# Abstract

**Pipelining** is the process of accumulating and executing computer instructions and tasks from the processor via a logical pipeline. It allows storing, prioritizing, managing and executing tasks and instructions in an orderly process..Today, pipelining is the primary implementation technique used to make fast CPUs. 
But, there are a few drawbacks of the aforementioned process, which include complexity and pipeline stalling. **_MIPS_** *(Million Instructions Per Second)* is a **_RISC ISA_** that is used for computing. 
Through this project, we aim to discuss and implement pipelining using the _MIPS_ architecture.
